% TRAIN_RF  A script that trains random forest trees from training data that has
%   been prepared from a typical HCP dataset.
%   Typical usage order: TRAIN_PREPROCESS, TRAIN_RF, TEST_RF (optional)
%
%   This is a script, you have to edit the 'settings'.

datasample_rate = 32; % determines the size of training sets. From each subject, we randomly draw patches with probability 1/datasample_rate
no_rnds = 8; % no of separate training sets to be created
feature_version = 6; % feature set used in Neuroimage paper. See PatchFeatureList.m for details
